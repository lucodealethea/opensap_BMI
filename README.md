Business Model Canvas Template
==============================

This is a set of templates for Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas that can be used for [openSAP Course Designing Business Models for the Digital Economy (Edition Q2/2017)](https://open.sap.com/courses/bmi1/).

Following template from [Alex Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas)

It is a tool for quick and fairly easy clarification of business models.

Original canvas is good for showing and analyzing existing businesses, however for startups, I found Ash Maurya's one, a little bit more convenient:

You might fork this, and use it to analyze your ideas.

For start there are three templates, 

- *canvas_1_value_delivery.html*
- *canvas_2_value_creation.html*
- *canvas_3_value_capturing.html*

that correspond to openSAP materials/recommendations as of week 2. 

The **canvas_complete.html** template would be the final result.

Other Templates **startup.html** which is more along the lines of what Ash Maurya is advising. Use this as a starting point for your analyses.
Or use **per_bus_model.html** if you want to go along with [Business Model YOU A One-Page Method for Reinventing Your Career](http://businessmodelyou.com/)

Just clone/fork this repo or download it as a zip if you want to work offline.
Go inside the openSAP_BMI folder and open template.html with your favorite HTML editor.

I have to mention existing online tools as well, ie. online collaborative canvas ( where the real value of the tool resides). I believe HTML way is slightly more convenient when it is about to freeze into a more detailled canvas.

Also there is one from Ash Maurya's Spark59:

And there is one promoted by Steve Blank:

The general idea and html is to be credited to Zeljko Dakic @ 
https://github.com/desireco/BusinessModelCanvasTemplate. 

And we'll give also credit to Piero Blunda @ https://github.com/pieroblunda/business-model-canvas that developed a chrome-extension that you might need to clone/debug/enhance quite a bit in order to produce something.

Enjoy.
