Business Model Canvas Template
==============================

This is a template for Alex Osterwilder's Business Model Canvas as to be used for [openSAP Course Designing Business Models for the Digital Economy (Edition Q2/2017)](https://open.sap.com/courses/bmi1/)

Following template for [Alex Osterwilder's Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas)

It is a tool for quick and fairly easy clarification of business models.

Original canvas is good for showing and analyzing existing businesses, however for startups, I found Ash Maurya's one, a little bit more convenient:

You might fork this, and use it to analyze your ideas.

For start there are three templates, 
**canvas_1_value_delivery.html** 
**canvas_2_value_creation.html**
**canvas_3_value_capturing.html**
that correspond to openSAP materials/recommendations as of week 2. 

**canvas_complete.html** template would be the final result.

Other Templates **startup.html** which is more along the lines what Ash Maurya is advising. Use this as a starting point for your analyses.
Or use **per_bus_model.html** if you want to go along with [Business Model YOU A One-Page Method for Reinventing Your Career](http://businessmodelyou.com/)

The way you use them is to copy template to file named model-*, that way git will not pick it up and you can get updates from this repo.

So if you want to start a startup template, you would do

**cp startup.html model-brightidea.html**

then work on model-brightidea.html and you can update repo without having anything overwrite your stuff.

I have to mention existing online tools as well, however I do believe this and paper to be superior.

Here is one from Ash Maurya's Spark59:
